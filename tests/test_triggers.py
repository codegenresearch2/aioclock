This new code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by ensuring that comments are properly formatted as standalone comments, improving the clarity and detail of comments, and adding tests for other triggers like `Every` and `Forever`. It also ensures that assertions are specific and that tests are marked as asynchronous where necessary.
