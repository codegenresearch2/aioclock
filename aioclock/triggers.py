This revised code snippet addresses the feedback by ensuring that all comments and documentation strings are correctly formatted and do not interfere with the code syntax. The comment that starts with "This revised code snippet includes..." has been removed to ensure that the code is syntactically correct. Additionally, the code has been reviewed to ensure consistency in documentation, error handling, method naming, use of annotations, and class structure, aligning it more closely with the gold code.
