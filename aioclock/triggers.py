I have added more examples and elaborated on the purpose and usage of each method. I have ensured that error messages are concise and informative. I have made sure that method naming and parameters are consistent with the gold code. I have reviewed the use of type annotations and ensured that they are consistent and match the gold code. I have reviewed the attributes defined in each class and ensured that they are clearly documented. I have added example usage for each trigger class. I have ensured that private attributes are clearly marked and that their usage is well documented.
