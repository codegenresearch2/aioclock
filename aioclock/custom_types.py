I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle.

1. I have updated the `PositiveNumber` annotation to specify an interval with a lower bound of 0 but no upper bound, matching the gold code.

2. I have ensured that the documentation for the enum members matches the phrasing and style of the gold code.

3. I have checked the formatting and spacing in the code to ensure consistency with the gold code.

Here is the updated code snippet:


from enum import auto
from typing import Annotated, Literal, Union

from annotated_types import Interval

from aioclock.utils import StrEnum

EveryT = Literal[
    "every monday",
    "every tuesday",
    "every wednesday",
    "every thursday",
    "every friday",
    "every saturday",
    "every sunday",
    "every day",
]

SecondT = Annotated[int, Interval(ge=0, le=59)]
MinuteT = Annotated[int, Interval(ge=0, le=59)]
HourT = Annotated[int, Interval(ge=0, le=24)]

PositiveNumber = Annotated[Union[int, float], Interval(ge=0)]

class Triggers(StrEnum):
    CRON = auto()
    """Cron job trigger."""
    EVERY = auto()
    """Every (x) time units, it gets triggered."""
    ONCE = auto()
    """Trigger once, then stop."""
    FOREVER = auto()
    """Keep running, as long as application is running."""
    ON_START_UP = auto()
    """Trigger on application start up."""
    ON_SHUT_DOWN = auto()
    """Trigger on application shut down."""
    AT = auto()
    """Trigger at a specific time."""


This updated code snippet should address the feedback received and bring it closer to the gold standard.
