I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle. Here's the updated code:

1. I have updated the `PositiveNumber` type annotation to match the gold code, specifying an interval with a lower bound of 0 but no upper bound.
2. I have reviewed the formatting of the comments and ensured that they are consistent with the gold code, paying attention to the spacing and alignment of the comments to maintain a clean and uniform style.
3. I have double-checked the imports and dependencies to ensure that they are necessary and correctly referenced, consistent with the gold code.

The code snippet should now be more closely aligned with the gold standard.
