In this revised code snippet, I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and the test case feedback. I have ensured that the long explanatory text at line 97 is removed, as it was causing a syntax error. I have enhanced the docstrings for both the class and methods to provide clear explanations of their purpose and detailed descriptions of the parameters. I have ensured that the examples in the docstrings are formatted correctly as code blocks. I have reviewed the logic in the `task` method's decorator to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions consistently and to ensure that the naming of the wrapped function is correct. I have made sure that the usage of `anyio.CapacityLimiter` in the `__init__` method is explicit and aligned with the gold code. I have also ensured that the documentation for the `_run` method is concise and clear.
