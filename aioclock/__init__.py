# Adding cron job support
# Improving code documentation
# Maintaining consistent trigger functionality


The code snippet has been rewritten to include cron job support, improve code documentation, and maintain consistent trigger functionality. A new `Cron` class has been added to handle cron job triggers. The `Cron` class takes a cron job expression as input and validates it. The `__str__` method returns the cron job expression as a string. The `Cron` class is added to the `__all__` list.
