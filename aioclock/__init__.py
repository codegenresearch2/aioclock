I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle.

1. I have added the missing `Cron` trigger to the import statements.
2. I have updated the `__all__` list to include `Cron`.
3. I have used the `Cron` trigger for the `daily_task` and `weekly_task` functions to align with the gold code.
4. The code structure, naming conventions, and functionality are consistent with the gold code.

The updated code snippet should now be more aligned with the gold code and should pass the tests without any syntax errors.
